# easyCLI - Because CLI>GUI
Allow easy use of Command Line Interface for basic use

#Why this?
I like Linux. When I learning c++ to school with my teacher. I'm forced to use Windows, because some function won't works on Linux.

#What I implemented?
* `_getch` - Existing on Windows. Added on Linux. :)
* `Easy use of color` - Allow same code for using of color for both OS (Text & background)
* `clear the screen` - Allow same code for using the system call for clear the screen on both OS.

#How To use
* `_getch()`

      ```c++
      int value=_getch();
      ```
